                The Gandhi Museum, dedicated to the life and teachings of Mahatma Gandhi, is a place of historical and cultural significance. Typically located in various parts of the world, these museums aim to preserve and showcase the legacy of one of the most influential figures in modern history.
                The museum often begins with an introduction to Gandhi's early life, detailing his upbringing, education, and formative experiences. Exhibits may include photographs, personal artifacts, and documents that provide insight into his journey. Visitors can trace Gandhi's evolution from a young lawyer in South Africa to the leader of India's nonviolent independence movement.
                One key aspect of the museum is its emphasis on Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence (Ahimsa) and his principles of truth, simplicity, and self-reliance. Exhibits may feature quotes, writings, and audiovisual presentations that highlight these principles, offering a deeper understanding of his ideologies.
