                The Vaigai River is a prominent river in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, and it holds cultural and historical significance, particularly in the city of Madurai. Here's a description of the Vaigai River in the context of Madurai:
                The Vaigai River gracefully meanders through the ancient city of Madurai, adding to the city's charm and providing a lifeline to the region. Originating in the Varusanadu Hills, the river flows eastward, eventually reaching the Vaigai Dam.
                In Madurai, the Vaigai River is not just a geographical feature but a cultural and historical icon. The river has been a witness to the city's rich history, with its banks dotted by temples, ghats, and vibrant local life. The riverbanks often serve as a place for religious ceremonies, rituals, and social gatherings.
